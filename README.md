The latest release of clover 5104 is installed (At the time of this efi), discrete graphics are disabled because they do not work in a laptop under hackintosh.



The system works as well as 10.13.6 and 10.14.6 and 10.15.6, as far as possible I will update the EFI.






In addition, I can say that the keyboard and USB are sharpened for this laptop for maximum convenience.
